# Simple App Container

A C# web application container for classroom projects. It has a simple request filter structure that is similar to how real application containers work.

Included is the libary source and a demo application. Both have a MonoDevelop project.

The demo application requires a local MySQL server.

See the DemoApp/Program.cs for a usage example.
